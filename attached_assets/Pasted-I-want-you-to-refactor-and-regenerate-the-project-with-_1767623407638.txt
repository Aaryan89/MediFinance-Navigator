I want you to refactor and regenerate the project with the following changes and constraints:

=====================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
=====================

1. Replace the entire backend with **FastAPI (Python)**.
2. Follow clean architecture:
   - routers/
   - services/
   - models/
   - schemas/
   - database/
3. Use **Pydantic models** for request/response validation.
4. Use **SQLAlchemy** (async preferred) for database interaction.
5. Expose REST APIs compatible with the existing React frontend.
6. Include automatic OpenAPI / Swagger documentation.

### Machine Learning / Data Models
* Import and integrate the following models and logic from the attached Jupyter notebooks:
  - [INSERT NOTEBOOK NAME 1]
  - [INSERT NOTEBOOK NAME 2]
* Convert notebook code into reusable Python modules.
* Ensure models load efficiently (lazy loading where applicable).
* If inference is required, expose endpoints like:
  - POST /predict
  - POST /analyze
  - POST /recommend

=====================
INDIA-SPECIFIC MEDICATION & PRICING LOGIC
=====================

1. Currency must be **Indian Rupees (INR ₹)**.
2. Medication pricing logic should follow Indian pharmaceutical practices:
   - Prices are typically per strip, bottle, or dosage unit
   - Support MRP (Maximum Retail Price)
   - Allow generic vs branded medication pricing
3. Support dosage-based calculations:
   - mg / ml based pricing
   - daily dose × number of days
4. Include tax logic if applicable (GST on medicines, configurable).
5. All monetary values should be stored as decimals (not floats).

=====================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React)
=====================

1. Keep the frontend in **React**.
2. Do NOT rewrite the app in another framework.
3. Ensure compatibility with the new FastAPI backend.
4. Update API service calls if endpoints change.

### Dark Mode
* Introduce **Dark Mode** with:
  - Toggle switch
  - System preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
  - Persistent setting using localStorage
* Use a clean theme system (CSS variables, Tailwind, or styled-components).
* Ensure accessibility contrast compliance.

=====================
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
=====================

* Environment variables for secrets and configs
* Proper error handling and validation
* Clear README with:
  - How to run backend
  - How to run frontend
  - API documentation
* Use Python 3.10+ for backend
* Keep code readable and well-commented

=====================
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
=====================

* Fully working FastAPI backend
* React frontend with dark mode
* India-specific medication pricing logic
* ML/data models correctly integrated from notebooks
* Clean, production-ready project structure
